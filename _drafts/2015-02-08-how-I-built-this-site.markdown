This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
The responsive front-end framework [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) is used for the layout. I've added minimal CSS for the styling.
The icons come from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

I used my [Dell Chromebook 11](http://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/chromebook-11/pd) to put it all together.
This is also the first time I've used [Cloud9](https://c9.io/); a cloud powered IDE. 
You can enable the Jekyll framework in Cloud9; instructions [here](https://docs.c9.io/frameworks_jekyll.html). 
Cloud9 takes care of managing all the dependencies and even allows me to start a Jekyll serve to preview my changes.
