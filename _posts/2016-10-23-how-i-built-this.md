This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the static website generator [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I used the [jekyll-theme-hackss](https://github.com/wemake-services/jekyll-theme-hackcss) theme that uses [hackcss.com](http://hackcss.com/)

The icons come from [here](https://codepen.io/ruandre/pen/howFi).

I used my [Dell Chromebook 11](http://www.dell.com/uk/business/p/chromebook-11/pd) to put it all together.
