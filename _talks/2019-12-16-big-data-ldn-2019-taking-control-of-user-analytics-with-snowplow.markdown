User analytics is well established at Auto Trader but breakthroughs in the cloud, big data and streaming technologies offer clear benefits above and beyond what we could do today. This talk describes how we migrated to Snowplow on Google Cloud for our user-analytics platform. Snowplow is an event streaming pipeline that provides many features such as a unified log of your users, event enrichments and a schema registry to enforce data integrity. I'll walk through why we chose to migrate, the overall Snowplow platform, the architectural benefits and how using Google BigQuery and DataFlow has been a huge success for Auto Trader.
