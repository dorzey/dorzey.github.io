I am a Senior Engineering Manager with an interest in AI, Data, and Engineering Leadership. I use technologies including Spark, Kafka, Java, Scala, Python and dbt on a daily basis. I have a strong interest in applying lean/agile methodologies to AI, Data & ML Engineering. And enjoy leading teams to produce innovative products.

I wrote the "The Implications of the CAP Theorem" chapter in [97 Things Every Data Engineer Should Know](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/97-things-every/9781492062400/). And have a [PhD in Computer Science](https://core.ac.uk/outputs/80770690/) and remain interested in AI and Knowledge Representation.
